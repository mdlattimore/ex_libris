    <h1 class="display-6">Welcome to My Literary Collection</h1>
    <p>This is a personal catalog of the books I collect with special interest—volumes that go beyond casual reading and
        reflect a deeper connection to certain authors and their worlds. Here you'll find works by J.R.R. Tolkien and
        Charles Dickens, as well as related books that explore their lives, influence, and the broader literary
        landscapes they helped shape. It’s not a complete library, but a curated space for the titles that matter most
        to me.</p>

    <p>In the collections, you'll find a few of what I consider "collectible" pieces, editions with some special
        significance. Among these include 5 first editions of Tolkien's <i>The Silmarillion</i> (my wife says I have a
        problem) and multiple copies of Dickens' <i>A Christmas Carol</i> (none of which are valuable in any monetary
        sense, but make up various presentations of one of my favorite stories of all time).</p>

    <p>Select books have what I call "Spotlight" pages: deeper dives into the more significant works. You can look at
        those Spotlights by following the links below or by following the link found on the individual edition
        pages.</p>
