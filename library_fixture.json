    "title": "The Silmarillion",
    "description": "This is the book J.R.R. Tolkien tried unsuccessfully to have published most of his life. *The Silmarillion* serves as the foundational mythology for all Middle-earth. Ranging from an account of creation, to the ordering of Middle-earth's inhabitants, to legendary tales of the First Age that serve as historical and cultural foundations for the events of the Third Age narrated by *The Hobbit* and *The Lord of the Rings*, *The Silmarillion* isn't a novel in the sense of Tolkien's most famous writings. Often reading like scripture or a historical chronicle, it comprises a kind of universal consciousness assumed in the stories of the Third Age. One gets the sense that all of *The Silmarillion* is relevant, even those parts that are never directly referenced in the later works. Knowing that Sauron was a Maia, for example, adds new dimensions to understanding the dark lord as portrayed in the Third Age.\r\n\r\nThis is not to say that *The Silmarillion* isn't a story. It is largely a collection of stories, all variously connected to one another. Stories of elven rebellion, kinslaying, heroes, villains, and, for my money, the greatest love story in all of romantic literature, *Beren and Lúthien*, which Tolkien considered the heart and soul of *The Silmarillion*. He was so enamored by this story that he often referred to his wife, Edith, as his Lúthien (and the names Beren and Lúthien are carved on their shared headstone in Wolvercote Cemetery).\r\n\r\nTolkien began writing many of these stories as a teenager, sometimes unaware that he was building a world, an act of, as he would call it, sub-creation. He began writing the earliest legends while recovering from trench fever during World War I, building a mythology that grew for decades. Over the years, writing in French trenches, military hospitals and barracks, at home when not teaching, and any other place time circumstances would allow, Tolkien kept building his world, complete with its own history, mythology, and even languages. It was a lifelong pursuit. Unfortunately it remained unfulfilled during his lifetime.\r\n\r\nAfter the surprising success of *The Hobbit*, a story originally conceived as a bedtime story for his kids, Tolkien perhaps saw this notoriety as a way to get the story he really wanted to tell into the world. His publisher, however, pressed Tolkien for a sequel, a follow-up to the tale of Bilbo Baggins, what became *The Lord of the Rings*. Reluctantly he undertook the task, often in stops and starts. It took 17 years for his to complete and publish LOTR. As it seemed the writing was nearing the end (it often seemed that way, but then the tale would continue to grow, taking on a life of its own), Tolkien hoped to publish *The Silmarillion* along with LOTR, insisting that the two were part of the same epic world. However, Allen & Unwin declined it, prompting Tolkien to briefly pursue other publishers before returning with just LOTR. He could never settle on a viable, publishable version, probably due to combination of perfectionism and fear of putting a period at the end of the tale he spent his entire life writing. And because the stories were never really settled but always evolving, it was difficult to nail down exactly what *The Silmarillion* was.\r\n\r\nThis doesn't mean no one read what he hoped would make up *The Silmarillion*. He submitted manuscripts to his publishers, who accepted them for consideration with the view of appeasing Tolkien, while not necessarily intending to publish the book. Readers employed by the publisher usually gave it, at best, lukewarm responses, regarding it as an author's indulgence of his own artistic sensibilities that wouldn't translate into popular appeal. Moreover, as LOTR grew, the problem of printing and publication cost loomed large. Increasingly the length of an already too long tale didn't make financial sense.\r\n\r\nIt was only after Tolkien's death in 1973, that serious work began on sifting through the myriad stories, often with competing versions, to create a publishable Silmarillion. This task fell to Tolkien's son and literary executor, Christopher Tolkien. Over the course of the next four years, Christopher pored through his father's notes, manuscripts containing marginalia, corrections, and disparate trajectories, to try to arrive at \"the text.\" In the end, he wove together these narrative strands in a way so as to produce as coherent a narrative as possible. By his own admission, it isn't perfect but the best he could do while trying to stay faithful to his father's vision (which, itself, wasn't always so well-defined).\r\n\r\n*The Silmarillion* was finally published in 1977 by George Allen & Unwin (the publisher of *The Hobbit* and LOTR). While it certainly doesn't have the widespread popular appeal of *The Hobbit* or LOTR, it has become an irreplaceable part of Tolkien’s legendarium to serious Tolkien lovers. On a personal note, it is my favorite of the Middle-earth tales. Much like Tolkien, I am especially taken with the tale of Beren and Luthien. That said, as the definitive backdrop for the events of the Third Age of Middle-earth, *The Silmarillion* is endlessly fascinating, becoming even more so after every reading. And that fascination only deepens with each return to *The Hobbit* and *The Lord of the Rings*, as their world becomes richer, more tragic, and more wondrous in light of the tales that came before.",

Bilbo Baggins is a hobbit who enjoys a comfortable, unambitious life, rarely travelling further than the pantry of his hobbit-hole in Bag End. But his contentment is disturbed when the wizard, Gandalf, and a company of thirteen dwarves arrive on his doorstep one day to whisk him away on an unexpected journey 'there and back again.' They have a plot to raid the treasure hoard of Smaug the Magnificent, a large and very dangerous dragon . . . Written for J.R.R. Tolkien's own children, The Hobbit was published on 21 September 1937. With a beautiful cover design, a handful of black & white drawings and two maps by the author himself, the book became an instant success and was reprinted shortly afterwards with five color plates. Tolkien's own selection of finished paintings and drawings have become inseparable from his text, adorning editions of The Hobbit for more than 85 years. But the published art has afforded only a glimpse of Tolkien's creative process, and many additional sketches, colored drawings and maps - although exhibited and published elsewhere - have never appeared within the pages of The Hobbit. In this unique enhanced edition of Tolkien's enchanting classic tale, the full panoply of his art is reproduced for the first time, presenting more than 50 illustrations to accompany Bilbo Baggins on his adventure 'there and back again.'",

They provide revealing insights into the significant role each place-name played in the stories, including those of Númenor, the island-kingdom once inhabited by Elendil and his sons, Isildur and Anárion, ancestors of Aragorn, that was sunk in a cataclysmic storm following the treacherous deeds of Sauron, as told in Of the Rings of Power in The Silmarillion.', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '006338731X'}, {'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780063387317'}], 'readingModes': {'text': False, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 0, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['Fiction'], 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'allowAnonLogging': False, 'contentVersion': 'preview-1.0.0', 'panelizationSummary': {'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}, 'imageLinks': {'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WNo60AEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WNo60AEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'}, 'language': 'en', 'previewLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=WNo60AEACAAJ&dq=isbn:9780063387317&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=WNo60AEACAAJ&dq=isbn:9780063387317&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'canonicalVolumeLink': 'https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Maps_of_Middle_Earth.html?hl=&id=WNo60AEACAAJ'}",

Tolkien himself and with the complete text printed in two colors. The Silmarillion fills in the background which lies behind the more popular work, and gives the earlier history of Middle-earth, introducing some of the key characters. The Silmarilli were three perfect jewels, fashioned by Fëanor, most gifted of the Elves, and within them was imprisoned the last Light of the Two Trees of Valinor. But the first Dark Lord, Morgoth, stole the jewels and set them within his iron crown, guarded in the impenetrable fortress of Angband in the north of Middle-earth. The Silmarillion is the history of the rebellion of Fëanor and his kindred against the gods, their exile from Valinor and return to Middle-earth, and their war, hopeless despite all the heroism, against the great Enemy. It is the ancient drama to which the characters in The Lord of the Rings look back, and in whose events some of them such as Elrond and Galadriel took part. The book also includes several shorter works: the Ainulindalë, a myth of the Creation, and the Valaquenta, in which the nature and powers of each of the gods is described. The Akallabêth recounts the downfall of the great island kingdom of Númenor at the end of the Second Age, and Of the Rings of Power tells of the great events at the end of the Third Age, as narrated in The Lord of the Rings. Tolkien could not publish The Silmarillion in his lifetime, as it grew with him, so he would leave it to his son, Christopher Tolkien, to edit the work from many manuscripts and bring his father's great vision to publishable form, so completing the literary achievement of a lifetime. This special edition presents anew this seminal first step towards mapping out the posthumous publishing of Middle-earth, and the beginning of an illustrious forty years and more than twenty books celebrating his father's legacy. This definitive new edition includes, by way of an introduction, a letter written by Tolkien in 1951 which provides a brilliant exposition of the earlier Ages, and for the first time in its history is presented with Tolkien's own paintings and drawings, which reveal the breathtaking grandeur and beauty of his vision of the First Age of Middle-earth.",

Tolkien, which tells the powerful story of a doomed young man who is sold into slavery and who swears revenge on the magician who killed his father. Kullervo son of Kalervo is perhaps the darkest and most tragic of all J.R.R. Tolkien s characters. Hapless Kullervo, as Tolkien called him, is a luckless orphan boy with supernatural powers and a tragic destiny. Brought up in the homestead of the dark magician Untamo, who killed his father, kidnapped his mother, and who tries three times to kill him when still a boy, Kullervo is alone save for the love of his twin sister, Wanona, and guarded by the magical powers of the black dog, Musti. When Kullervo is sold into slavery he swears revenge on the magician, but he will learn that even at the point of vengeance there is no escape from the cruellest of fates. Tolkien wrote that The Story of Kullervo was the germ of my attempt to write legends of my own, and was a major matter in the legends of the First Age; his Kullervo was the ancestor of Turin Turambar, tragic incestuous hero of The Silmarillion. In addition to being a powerful story in its own right, The Story of Kullervo published here for the first time with the author s drafts, notes and lecture-essays on its source-work, The Kalevala, is a foundation stone in the structure of Tolkien s invented world.\"",

Bound in real cloth, printed on high quality paper, and featuring ribbon markers and gilt edges, Macmillan Collector's Library are books to love and treasure. When A Christmas Carol was first published in 1843 it was an overnight success, and set a precedent that was to be followed by other Christmas books, including The Chimes (1844) and The Cricket (1845). Each book was published at the same time of year, in the same format, and extolled similar values about the virtues of love, charity and the family unit. But none would achieve the cult status of A Christmas Carol, a book so popular it has become part of the landscape of the traditional Christmas, or produce a character as extraordinarily memorable. A celebration of Christmas, a tale of redemption and a critique on Victorian society, Dickens’ atmospheric novella follows the miserly, penny-pinching Ebenezer Scrooge who views Christmas as ‘humbug’. It is only through a series of eerie, life-changing visits from the ghost of his deceased business partner Marley and the spirits of Christmas past, present and future that he begins to see the error of his ways. With heart-rending characters, rich imagery and evocative language, the message of A Christmas Carol remains as significant today as when it was first published.

Tolkien came to write his original masterpiece The Hobbit includes his complete unpublished draft version of the story, together with notes and illustrations by Tolkien himself. The Hobbit was first published on September 21,1937. Like its sequel, The Lord of the Rings, it is a story that \"grew in the telling,\" and many characters and plot threads in the published text are quite different from the story J.R.R. Tolkien first wrote to read aloud to his young sons as one of their \"fireside reads.\" Together in one volume, The History of the Hobbit presents the complete text of the unpublished manuscript of The Hobbit, accompanied by John Rateliff's lively and informative account of how the book came to be written and published. Recording the numerous changes made to the story both before and after publication, he examines--chapter by chapter--why those changes were made and how they reflect Tolkien's ever-growing concept of Middle-earth. As well as reproducing the original version of one of the world's most popular novels--both on its own merits and as the foundation for The Lord of the Rings--this book includes many little-known illustrations and draft maps for The Hobbit by Tolkien himself. Also featured are extensive commentaries on the dates of composition, how Tolkien's professional and early mythological writings influenced the story, the imaginary geography he created, and how Tolkien came to revise the book years after publication to accommodate events in The Lord of the Rings. Endorsed by Christopher Tolkien as a companion to his essential 12-volume The History of Middle-earth, this thoughtful and exhaustive examination of one of the most treasured stories in English literature offers fascinating new insights for those who have grown up with this enchanting tale, and will delight any who are about to enter Bilbo's round door for the first time.",

It stands at the beginning of the entire conception of Middle-earth and Valinor, for the Lost Tales were the first form of the myths and legends that came to be called The Silmarillion. Embedded in English legend and association, they are set in the narrative frame of the great westward voyage of a mariner named Eriel (or AElfwine). His destination is Tol Eressea, the Lonely Isle where Elves dwell; from them he learns their true history, the Lost Tales of Elfinesse. The Tales include the earliest accounts of Gods and Elves, Dwarves, Balrogs, and Orcs; of the Silmarils and the Two Trees of Valinor; of Nargothrond and Gondolin; of the geography and cosmography of their invented world. The Book of Lost Tales is published in two volumes. The first contains the Tales of Valinor; and this second past includes Beren and Luthien, Turin and the Dragon, and the only full narratives of the Necklace of the Dwarves and the Fall of Gondolin. Each tale is followed by a commentary, together with associated poems, and each volume contains extensive information on names and vocabulary of the earliest Elvish languages. Additional books in this series will extend the history of Middle-earth as it was refined and enlarged in later years and will include the long Lays of Beleriand, the Ambarkanta or Shape of the World, the Lhammas or Account of Tongues, annals, maps, and many other previously unpublished writings of J.R.R.
